                  703 million people are drinking dirty water. A lack of access
                  to clean water forces families to journey away from home and
                  makes it harder to earn an income. Dirty water keeps kids out
                  of school and steals their education.

                  But it doesn’t have to be this way. You can help provide

                  and girls. A gift of just $20 a month is enough to bring 6
                  people— an entire family— clean water each year.
